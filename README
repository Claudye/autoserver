# autoserver

**autoserver** is a modular, extensible CLI tool written in Go for automatically setting up complete development environments across multiple programming languages and frameworks.

Designed to be fast, distro-aware, and developer-friendly, `autoserver` removes the repetitive steps required to configure servers or local machines â€” offering a clean, prompt-driven interface for installing only what you need.
